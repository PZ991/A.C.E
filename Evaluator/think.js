expectation affects the emotion and impact of something as well as memorability

    decay rate

    variable needed[]

    emotion affected[emotion name, target]

Emotion:
    Pleasant/unpleasant
    neurons/variables that connect to each other (memories)
    experience(memories), expectation affects the emotion impact
    time dilution

    final operation+value affected->memory sequence = memory on how to do things


Action:

    

    variable change- plan objective of action
    action can have imprinted memory
    combo
   
    Other variables:
        desire contradictions(laziness, abilities  )

    Memory Sequence
    final output variables[name,operation,value to operate with](int1, add, int2)

SITUATION
    user has ownership of money
    user is hungry
    in memory user knows someone to trade
    trade in memory is a sequence of: (change some money ownership change to seller, action=give,target=seller),(seller give some bread ownership to buyer) with memory result = humeger - some value
    user eats, if applicable

    poor = hunger =sad, why sad when hungry? because in the poor's memory all possible actions cannot be done currently
    someone gave food(change ownership from owner to poor) = poor hunger decrease = from sad to happy + greatful
    poor memory add person to memory, happy because person
    add to memory
    action- receiver - effects - time
