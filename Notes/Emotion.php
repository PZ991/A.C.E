Weighted Score Approach+Multi-dimensional Approach+Contextual Triggers


const emotionalState = {
  primary: 'joy',        // Strongest emotion
  secondary: 'anxiety',  // Second strongest
  intensity: 0.7,        // How strong overall (0-1)
  stability: 0.4         // How likely to change
};



// Game events modify emotion scores
function processEvent(event) {
  switch(event.type) {
    case 'achievement':
      emotionScores.joy += 20;
      emotionScores.contentment += 10;
      break;
    case 'betrayal':
      emotionScores.anger += 30;
      emotionScores.disappointment += 25;
      break;
  }
  
  // Decay emotions over time
  decayEmotions(0.95);
}



const emotionalState = {
  primary: 'joy',        // Strongest emotion
  secondary: 'anxiety',  // Second strongest
  intensity: 0.7,        // How strong overall (0-1)
  stability: 0.4         // How likely to change
};




so each emotion should have a stability,intensity, multiplier,min/max thereshold, and decay rate
emotion is based on how each person grew up, and how they were treated
based on their own experience, each emotion should be affected differently


main emotions are like a multiplier but if there are two highest emotion they are added
and it's value will act as a multiplier if there are also values for the other emotion
two highest can also be added to result in another emotion

high intensity of one emotion will result in two of the same emotion result

the longer a person is in a state of emotion, the more stable it becomes
the longer a person is in a state of emotion, the more intensity it becomes

thresholdactive is the threshold for the emotion to be active, this will base on the stability and the prolonged state of the emotion

actions and words can also affect the emotion

memories and thoughts can also affect the emotion

person1 hates person2
person 3 fears person2
person1 punches person2

person1= anger
person2= fear -> relief/joy
person3=anger (if unexpected by thought then also add surprise)



consider the following:

ok so with the current system heres what i want:

player variables:
health=100
attack=0
equippedleft=null
equippedright=null
backpack=[]

operations:
if there are items that have tag "pickup" then add the item to the backpack, destroy world item


pill:
if there is any entity with health less than 50 then add 10 to the health of the entity, destroy the item


sword:
attack=10
decay=0.2

if decay =1 destroy item
if on backpack:
  if there is sword in the backpack and no equippedleft then equip it to the left hand
  only one of these can be equipped at a time

if equipped add operation:
  add sword attack to player attack 

shield:
defense=10
maxdefense=30

if equipped add operation:
  shield is destroyed after damage into it is more or equqal to the max defense
  if there is an incoming damage into health, check if there is a shield in the backpack and if there is then damage the shield first, if there is no shield then damage health
if on backpack:
  if there is shield in the backpack and no equippedright then equip it to the right hand

if decay =1 destroy item

demon:
attack=10
health=100

if player is near attack player
