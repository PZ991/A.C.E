Core Elements
Subject (S) - The person, thing, or concept that performs the action or is being described. It's who or what the sentence is about.

The dog barked.
Sarah is reading.

Verb (V) - The action word or state of being that tells us what the subject does or what condition it's in.

The dog barked.
Sarah is reading.

Object (O) - Receives the action of the verb. There are two types:

Direct Object - directly receives the action: "Sarah reads a book"
Indirect Object - tells us to whom or for whom the action is done: "Sarah gave her friend a book"

Complement (C) - Completes the meaning of the verb by describing or renaming the subject or object.

Subject complement: "Sarah is a teacher" (describes Sarah)
Object complement: "We painted the house blue" (describes the house)

Adjunct (A) - Adds extra information about when, where, how, or why something happens. These are optional elements that provide context.

"Sarah reads in the library" (where)
"Yesterday, Sarah read a book" (when)
"Sarah reads carefully" (how)

How Each Pattern Works
SV: Basic action - "Birds fly"
SVO: Action with a target - "Birds eat seeds"
SVC: Describes the subject - "Birds are beautiful"
SVA: Action with context - "Birds fly south"
SVOC: Action that changes the object - "We consider birds amazing"
SVOA: Action with target and context - "Birds build nests carefully"
SVIODO: Giving or showing something to someone - "Birds teach their young survival skills"
The patterns with A at the beginning simply add contextual information at the start:
ASVC: "Every spring, birds are active"
ASVO: "In winter, birds eat berries"
The patterns with multiple adjuncts (AA) include additional contextual details like time, place, manner, or reason all in one sentence.

i 

I want to give money to people in need
I= subject
want to =future action
give= action
money = object
people = direct object
in need = description

why= poor
poor = hard life/ starvation/death

Views
giving poor = good
    sub branch= giving poor that use money for bad things = bad

based on these patterns, i want to create a function that can process a sentence and return the pattern that it fits into.
use also the wordprocessor since context creates tags for the words and the wordprocessor can process the words and correct words to use





Objects uses the Evaluator and Values to get variables like details, appearance, position, pretty mch everythg about an object/person/place
there are also global Values using the same system like Time which runs indefinitely
there is also Actions
there is also Universal

then use the a system that can process functions that makes sentences/semantics that give necessary information for conversation
